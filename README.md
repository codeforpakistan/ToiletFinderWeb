Inorder to improve the sanitation and hygiene conditions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Watsan Cell(Local Government Department) in collaboration with KPITB under the KP Government Innovation Fellowship Program, has developed a digital solution to facilitate the public in finding, exploring, using and promoting the use of public toilets. The Public Toilet Finder app has a lot of great features enabling citizens of KP province to take care of their health & hygiene by searching for clean and safe public & private toilets. The app enables users to search for the nearest toilet based on the user's current location. There is also provision for extra search filters such as finding accessibility toilets or finding toilets for women. The mission behind creating this app was to create public awareness and improve the quality of health & hygiene of the citizens of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. There is also a built-in mechanism where the publicly managed toilets can be rated by citizens themselves, informing the Watsan cell about the cleanliness and/or lack of any facilities in the washrooms.
